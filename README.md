Hello World!

Matthias here, I like a lot of programming languages, each one different than the other, but still similiar in an odd way.
Some examples of the languages I really enjoy working with are: C, C++, Python (2&3), JavaScript (also in Node.js), Lua, ...

However, before I continue on talking for too long, I'll just continue with this tutorial right here:
https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/

Thank you very dearly if you took the time to read this, it does mean something to me ...
Anyway,
Love Matthias
